# Tile and Sprite Size Specifications

## Overview
This document tracks the art asset size decisions for our isometric game, optimized for 1080p display.

## Tile Specifications
- **Tile Size**: 120x60 pixels
- **Ratio**: 2:1 (width:height) for proper isometric appearance
- **Viewport Coverage**: 16x18 tiles visible on 1080p screen (1920÷120 = 16, 1080÷60 = 18)

### Reasoning
- Clean, simple math for positioning and calculations
- Good balance between detail level and art production time
- Manageable viewport size for level design

## Character Specifications
- **Character Size**: 90x45 pixels (height x width)
- **Scale**: 1.5 tiles tall (90÷60 = 1.5)
- **Proportions**: 2:1 ratio (height:width)

### Reasoning
- Natural scale relative to environment
- Simple math for grid positioning (90 = 1.5 × 60)
- Good size for hand-drawn detail without excessive animation workload

## Quick Reference
- 1 tile = 60px tall
- Character = 1.5 tiles tall
- Screen shows 16×18 tiles at 1080p
- All dimensions use clean multiples for easy calculations

## Notes
- These sizes prioritize simple math and manageable art production
- Slight deviation from "perfect" isometric ratios (128x64) won't be visually noticeable
- Can scale proportionally for other resolutions if needed
